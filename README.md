# Using this Page

 - This is where I keep my notes and cheatsheets. If you are viewing these pages in a browser, you can use the table of contents to browse. If you are viewing in vim, run 

``` shell
setlocal foldmethod=expr foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)[0]!=\#\"`
```
 and use ``zM`` + `zR` to fold/unfold all sections.
