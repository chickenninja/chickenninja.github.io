# About Me

	Namaste. I am Sean, and I work for Apigee/Google as an API Architect.

# Using this Page

	- This is where I keep my notes and cheatsheets. If you are viewing this on a browser, you can use the table of contents to browse. If you are viewing this markdown file in vim, run `set foldmethod=indent` and use `zM` + `zR` to fold/unfold all sections.

# Git

## Basics
	- You can add all files in a directory to a commit by using 
	- Something else 
	- Something else again
	- [Sample](/sample.sh)
	- [Feature](/feature.md)

	```shell
	git add .
	```
